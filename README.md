# Connect 4 - Arcade

This repo is meant to allow Connect 4 to be played using real-world inputs (button/sensor triggers).


## Parent Repo Notes

This project is forked from another one that implements the [Frontend Mentor: Connect 4 Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/connect-four-game-6G8QVH923s)


This project is written in `node.js`. The `src` (source) directory contains the raw pre-production files. The `dist` (distribution) contains the minimized production files.

_HOWEVER_: Because the project is written in Frontend logic (for now), it needs to be launch with a simple HTTP server (i.e. `python3 -m http.server`)


### Tooling - sass

https://sass-lang.com/guide/

`sass` is a more advanced `css` that compiles `css` files. `sass` has inheritance, variables, and a number of other features that make `css` easier to write.

### Tooling - gulp

https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start

`gulp` is essentially `make` for Javascript. The `gulpfile.js` can set how various files should be combined.ÃŸ
